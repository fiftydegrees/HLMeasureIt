# HLMeasureIt

HLMeasureIt is a lightweight Photoshop script that allows user to simply draw measures of any element.

![HLMeasureIt Sample](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fiftydegrees/HLMeasureIt/master/README-Files/hlmeasureit-sample1.png)

## Installation

 * Drag the `HLMeasureIt.jsx` file into _<Photoshop Installation Folder>_/Presets/Scripts/.
 * Restart Photoshop, select a layer with Ctrl+Click (default behavior) and run File > Scripts > HLMeasureIt.

If you feel easy with Git, create a submodule to make updates easier.

### One-click usage

You can bind the script on a keyboard shortcut.

 * Open Window > Scripts, and create a new script. Name it `HLMeasureIt` and select your favorite keyboard shortcut.
 * Run File > Scripts > HLMeasureIt (for the last time).
 * Stop script recording. It's done, you can now run the script with your shortcut.
