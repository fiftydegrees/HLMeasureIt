# HLMeasureIt

HLMeasureIt is an lightweight Photoshop script that allow user to simply create measures of any element.

## Installation

 * Drag the `HLMeasureIt.jsx` file into _<Photoshop Installation Folder>_/Presets/Scripts/.
 * Restart Photoshop, select a layer with Ctrl+Click (default behavior) and run File > Scripts > HLMeasureIt.

If you feel easy with Git, create a submodule to make updates easier.

### One-click usage

You can bind the script on a keyboard shortcut.

 * Open Window > Scripts, and create a new script. Name it `HLMeasureIt` and select your favorite keyboard shortcut.
 * Run File > Script > HLMeasureIt (for the last time).
